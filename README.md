# Introduction.
In order to use this model you need to create the environment on you computer.This is a Keras easy type data for beginners of Computer Vision.
Data consists of 10 different types of images in both train and test data.Each type has 5000 images of total 50,000 32x32 pixel images in train data .Another 10,000 in test data.I used CNN model.  


# Step - 1 . 
 - Downloading model

-First click the buttons *windows+R*  and type *cmd* in box below clone my model from github on the black window

> C:\>  git clone https://github.com/Mukhriddin19980901/cifar10.git

-write this command on black window.
 
> cd cifar10
 
# Step - 2 

-you need to upgrade your pip command to create environment

> python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip


-Here you need to install environment module and you can create  your virtual environment(you can give any name)

> python -m venv pip install --user virtualenv

> python -m venv
